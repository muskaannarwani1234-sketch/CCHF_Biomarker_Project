# Biomarker Identification for Crimean–Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF)

## Project Overview
Crimean–Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral disease with a high fatality rate.
This project focuses on identifying potential host gene expression biomarkers associated with CCHF infection using transcriptomic data and bioinformatics approaches.

## Dataset
- Source: NCBI GEO
- Organism: Homo sapiens
- Study type: CCHF infected vs healthy controls

## Tools & Technologies
- R programming
- DESeq2 / limma
- WGCNA
- GSVA
- ssGSEA
- Machine learning(LASSO, RF, SVM)
- GO/KEGG/GSEA
- GEOquery

## Methodology
1. Data retrieval from GEO
2. Data preprocessing and normalization
3. Differential gene expression analysis
4. Co-expression network analysis
5. Immune cell enrichment analysis
6. Identification of candidate biomarkers

## Current Status
- Data preprocessing completed
- DEG analysis performed
- Network-based biomarker identification in progress
